# Event handling
V2 of Houdini will have an event based system as described in #113. Events are ONE-WAY notifications from a publisher to a subscriber. We wrap `ActiveSupport::Notifications` a custom class called `Houdini::Notifications` (there's a chance we'll want to use a different notification system at some point).

Unless there is a very good reason, the data necessary for handling the event should be passed in as actual objects and attributes, not references to a database key. The idea is that you shouldn't have to worry about additional changes to entities being made before you can react to the event.
